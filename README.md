#  Book Search Engine

## Description
The Book Search Engine is a MERN stack application that allows users to search for books using the Google Books API. This project involves refactoring the application to use GraphQL with Apollo Server, replacing the existing RESTful API. Users can search for books, save them to their account, and view or remove saved books.
